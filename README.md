This project is a static clone of the Amazon homepage, created using only HTML and CSS. It closely replicates the structure and visual design of the original Amazon site, featuring
key elements such as the navigation bar, search box, promotional hero section, product cards, and footer. The layout includes the Amazon logo, delivery address, language selection,
sign-in area, shopping cart icon. All styling is accomplished with CSS, mirroring Amazonâ€™s signature color scheme and layout. This project serves as an excellent exercise in 
frontend development, helping to reinforce foundational web design skills without the use of JavaScript or backend functionality.
